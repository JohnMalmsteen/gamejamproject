# gamejamproject | Wiper

This is a game made during the 48 hour Game Jam @ 091 Labs, May 2015 event. 
The game jam's theme was 

>*"What if all the conspiracies are true?"*.

Wiper (working title) is a game in which you play a Men In Black agent who 
must question people in the town to discern if they know the truth about a 
recent visit from extra terrestrial aliens, and if so to wipe their memories 
with a zap from your Neuralizer.

Over the course of the game jam we aimed to implement the basic gameplay.
The people being questioned will grow suspicious and run away if you bother
them too much. If they run when you think they know too much and cannot
wipe their memory, then you may decide to shoot and kill them to keep the
truth getting out. We planned many different 'you suck' game over screens,
severity being on how horrible you are to the townsfolk, however these
didn't make the 48 hour deadline.
